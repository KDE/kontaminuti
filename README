Literally 'count minutes' - the Italian word for cooking alarm.
I chose this name because one of the Pomodory Technique helpers
is a cooking alarm in the form of a red tomato.

Initially a shameless rip of kteatime. Did some refactoring, futzed
about with the texts and did some work on the icons etcetera.

Lots to be desired. Basic ideas:

- Fix the thing so it works better
- Optionally tie in with the todo list in kontact
- Optionally tie in with the journal to remmember tasks done
- Optionally play a ticking sound or something similar to
  improve your focus during execution of the tasks
- add the ability to pause the tasks
- Display the number of remaining minutes in the icon
- Change the color to a green tomato if task is done
