Literally 'count minutes' - the Italian word for cooking alarm.
I chose this name because one of the Pomodory Technique helpers 
is a cooking alarm in the form of a red tomato.

Initially a shameless rip of kteatime. Did some refactoring, futzed
about with the texts and did some work on the icons etcetera.

Lots to be desired. Basic ideas:

- Fix the thing so it works better
- Tie in with the todo list in kontact
- Tie in with the journal to remmember tasks done
- Make above two optional
